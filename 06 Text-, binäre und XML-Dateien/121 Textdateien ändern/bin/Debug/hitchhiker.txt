3: "The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy" 
4: 
5: von Douglas Adams:
6: 
7: "Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable  end  of
8: the  western  spiral  arm  of  the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
9: yellow sun.
10: 
11: Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two  million  miles
12: is  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-
13: descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  still
14: think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
15: 
16: This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
17: of  the  people  on  it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
18: Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these
19: were  largely  concerned with the movements of small green pieces
20: of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't  the  small
21: green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
22: 
23: And so the problem remained; lots of the people  were  mean,  and
24: most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
25: 
26: Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a  big
27: mistake  in  coming  down  from the trees in the first place. And
28: some said that even the trees had been a bad move,  and  that  no
29: one should ever have left the oceans.
30: 
31: And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after  one  man
32: had  been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be
33: nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on  her  own  in  a
34: small  cafe  in  Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that
35: had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how  the
36: world  could  be  made  a  good and happy place. This time it was
37: right, it would work, and no one would  have  to  get  nailed  to
38: anything.
39: 
40: Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone  to  tell  anyone-
41: about  it,  a  terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea
42: was lost forever.
43: 
44: This is not her story.
45: 
46: But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and  some
47: of its consequences.
48: 
49: It is also the story of a book, a book called The  Hitch  Hiker's
50: Guide  to  the  Galaxy  -  not  an Earth book, never published on
51: Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or
52: heard of by any Earthman.
53: 
54: Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
55: 
56: in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out
57: of  the  great  publishing  houses  of  Ursa  Minor - of which no
58: Earthman had ever heard either.
59: 
60: Not only is it a wholly remarkable book,  it  is  also  a  highly
61: successful  one  -  more  popular  than  the  Celestial Home Care
62: Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More  Things  to  do  in  Zero
63: Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of
64: philosophical blockbusters Where God Went  Wrong,  Some  More  of
65: God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
66: 
67: In many of the more relaxed civilizations on  the  Outer  Eastern
68: Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted
69: the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the  standard  repository  of
70: all  knowledge  and  wisdom, for though it has many omissions and
71: contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly  inaccurate,
72: it  scores  over the older, more pedestrian work in two important
73: respects.
74: 
75: First, it is slightly cheaper; and  secondly  it  has  the  words
76: Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.
77: 
78: But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its
79: extraordinary   consequences,   and   the  story   of  how  these
80: consequences are inextricably intertwined  with  this  remarkable
81: book begins very simply.
82: 
83: It begins with a house."
